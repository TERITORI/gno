# Justice DAO

The goal of Justice DAO is to select random members from the DAO members to resolve the conflict on Escrow service.

Those random members selected all have same voting power and those members do on-chain chat and resolve the conflict between two parties.

We consider the conflict proposal as a specific proposal called `Justice DAO Proposal`, while normal proposal is for internal DAO management.

Justice DAO uses `VRF` realm to determine random members.
